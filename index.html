        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>This documentation outlines the design process, rationale behind design choices, and insights gained from the visualization project that displays average audience ratings for various movie genres. The goal of this project was to create an interactive and informative bar chart that allows users to easily compare audience ratings across different genres.</p>

        <h3>Design Process</h3>
        <h4>Initial Ideas</h4>
        <p>In the initial stages of the project, I brainstormed various ways to visualize the data. I considered different chart types, including pie charts, line graphs, and bar charts. I decided that a bar chart would be the most effective way to represent the average audience ratings by genre due to its clarity and ease of comparison.</p>
        
        <h4>Iteration and Refinement</h4>
        <p>After selecting the bar chart as the primary visualization method, I created a prototype using sample data. I iterated on the design by adjusting the layout, colors, and tooltips based on feedback from peers. The final design features a clean layout with a focus on readability and user interaction.</p>

    <div class="section" id="rationale">
        <h3>Rationale of Design Choices</h3>
        <h4>Color Choices</h4>
        <p>I chose a blue color palette for the bars to convey a sense of trust and reliability, which is often associated with blue tones. The hover effect changes the color to a lighter shade to provide visual feedback to users, enhancing interactivity.</p>

        <h4>Layout and Arrangement</h4>
        <p>The bars are arranged in descending order based on average audience ratings, allowing users to quickly identify which genres have the highest ratings. The y-axis represents the genres, while the x-axis represents the average audience ratings, making it intuitive for users to understand the data.</p>

        <h4>Interaction Design</h4>
        <p>Tooltips are implemented to display the exact ratings when users hover over the bars, providing additional context and enhancing the user experience.</p>

        <h3>Findings and Insights</h3>
        <p>Through the visualization, it was observed that certain genres consistently received higher audience ratings. This insight can be valuable for filmmakers and marketers in understanding audience preferences.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="conclusion">
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The visualization effectively communicates the average audience ratings by genre, allowing for easy comparison and analysis. The design choices made throughout the project contributed to a user-friendly experience that highlights key insights.</p>
